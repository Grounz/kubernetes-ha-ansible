Your Kubernetes master has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of machines by running the following on each node
as root:

  kubeadm join 172.16.1.29:6443 --token d6t03l.o2hp7ngtgvvpfpxd --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:520c7d7bb0efc031da71ce6e39ddc4087e8e4fa3ef68eaf724404ae1e84a11a6
